## Core information

* Tutorial - https://symfony.com/book
* Online - https://symfony.com/doc/5.0/the-fast-track/en/index.html
* Core git - https://github.com/the-fast-track/

## Readme

I will write down all information about installing. Partly different from core tutorial book.

### New project

* install cli - https://symfony.com/download
* or install from composer https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html
* start server `symfony server:start -d` - for me it's working on localhost:8000
* https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#ide
* install php extension `sudo apt install php7.4-pgsql`
